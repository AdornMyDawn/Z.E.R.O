Z.E.R.O is my personal AI assistant, inspired by Jarvis and Edith. My goal is to create a highly intelligent, versatile system tailored to assist me in research, organization and my day to day life.

Vision
Z.E.R.O aims to be an advanced digital assistant that:
Information & Research; retrieves & manages data from various sources, provides scientific, academic, or general information to assist with schoolwork, personal research, and projects.

Scheduling & Task Management
Manages personal schedules, reminders, and deadlines. As well as tracking progress on tasks and projects of mine, providing notifications or suggestions to optimize time and productivity.

Smart Assistance & AR integration
Unlike tony stark i am not iron man sadly therefore Z.E.R.O doesn't have a suit to be downloaded in BUT it can be downloaded in AR glasses, smart marts, and other technology i will develop (cars, phones etc) As well as supporting my love for engineering, architecture, safety protocols, and spatial awareness tasks. Offering real-time alerts, such as nearby sex offenders or criminals.

Data Protection & Security
it will ensure sensitive information is protected, by implementing security protocols to safeguard personal and project-related data.

Cloud Integration (Inspired by Edith)
providing full access to my cloud storage and files, making it easier file management, retrieval and organization across various devices.

Goals
Z.E.R.O is designed to evolve alongside my needs in life, from schoolwork and research to larger projects, personal safety and advanced tech interaction. My vision is to eventually integrate all aspects of personal productivity, safety and knowledge management into one AI system. while making sure he doesn't do AI ART LOL, Lastly..

Z.E.R.O's name came from my closest friend who passed, i miss him dearly and this is my way to keep him close to me we all grieve in different ways apparently my brain is creating an A.I. based off of him lol so please, don't steal my work i created this to keep a friend close and i'd rather it not fall into the hands of someone who's going to do werid stuff with it.
